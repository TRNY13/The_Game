# The_Game
Over all I had quite a few blockers throughout completing this iteration of the project. I was unable to continue with the logic I had early on in the development stage of the 
project due to time constraints. I chose to prioritize having a functioning game that aslo had some working CSS/HTML elements. While completing this project I strenghtened both
my logical coding skills and CSS abilities as well. I will continue improving and optimizing this game as I obtain more skills. My stretch goals included having audio cues in 
the game, a game reset/start button, html elements moving when prompted, a round system, a scoring system, and many more. Overall I am excited with what I was able to 
put forward. Looking forward to continue adding to this project. Overall the technologies I used were fairly straightforward. The player inputs a "Punch" string into the submission
field and then can start playing the game. The overall goal is to decrease the AI's HP before you'res hits zero. Both the AI & player start off with 10 HP and each hit decreases that
value by 1. Throughout the game the user is prompted with information about if there attacks land or the AI's. Once one of the players HP lands to 0 the game is concluded.
